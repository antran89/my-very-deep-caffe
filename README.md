# Fork of Caffe
**This is a fork used for video action recognition, mainly two-stream CNN networks.**

Some un-official layers developed or merged into this repo:
- FlowData layer: use a FlowData Reader to read flow data from LDMB database.
- Modified DataTransformer methods: which can read images from resized images, rescale back and then do transformations.
- 3D convolution/pooling layers. Sofware works well with 3D-CNN network.

We choose to keep our `my-very-deep-caffe` to be aligned with the original of Caffe's fork commit 5a201dd960840c319cefd9fa9e2a40d2c76ddd73. 
We would like to preserve the strength of BLVC Caffe software which is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity 
in mind. Our software also inherits training mechanism from multiple GPUs from BLVC Caffe.

The examples to use the software available at [two-stream FCAN repository](https://github.com/antran89/two-stream-fcan).

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.
